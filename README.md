# CamAlert
Originally created for VBPS

# Purpose
Check list of cameras to confirm whether they are online, then send an email with the IP of unreachable cameras

# How to Use
First Setup:
Open CamAlert.py with a text editor of your choice (Notepad++ recommended)
Update Line 35 to include the email you would like to use as the mail sender (Note: Must use gmail services)
Update Line 36 to include the password for the chosen email
Update line 37 to include the recipients of the script's emails

After Setup:
Make sure you have the latest version of python installed on your machine, then run the script

Tip: Use an application/script scheduler and have the script run once a night. Windows has a
built in feature for this you can research.
